## Installation

1. Drag and drop
2. Adjust `config.lua` to your liking

## How to Use

You walk, you quack. It's just that easy.

- Use command `/quack` if enabled in the config to toggle ducky steps
- If using `AlwaysStart` in config, duck footsteps will automatically enable when the script starts, or the player spawns
- Use the inventory item (if added) to toggle duck mode on the fly

## Features

- ü¶Ü We can quack if we want to. We can leave your friends behind. Cause if your friends don't quack. And if they don't quack. Well they're no friends of mine
- üõ†Ô∏è Compatible with qb-core, qbx_core, ox_core, and es_extended frameworks
- üåê Networked: other players can hear your duck footsteps within the configured distance
